 * Adapter for the Aleesa Website Form intake.

 * `leadSource: "website_form"`, carrying the full submission. It is a
 * *second* destination alongside the lead email, not a replacement for it —
 *  see `deliverLead` in ./index.
 *
 *   POST {ALEESA_API_URL}/api/v1/integrations/website-form/submit
 *   x-api-key: wform_…
 *   {
 *     "formId":    "contact-assessment",

 *   }
 *
 *   -> 201 { "success": true, "data": { "submissionId": "…", "leadId": "L-…" } }
 *
 * Aleesa derives the contact record from the field *names*, matching
 * `full_name` / `name` and `email` (case-insensitively) — so those two keys
 * are part of the contract, not cosmetic. Everything else is carried through
 * verbatim onto the lead's notes and its submission detail page.
